# Clambake: GitHub-Native Agent Orchestration CLI

## Overview

A high-performance Rust CLI tool that orchestrates 8-12 concurrent autonomous coding agents using GitHub's native agile development platform. Clambake integrates Claude Code sub-agents with Arize Phoenix observability to provide a complete multi-agent development infrastructure. It routes tickets, coordinates concurrent agent work, and ensures completed code lands on main through proper GitHub workflows - making enterprise-scale multi-agent development feasible when "just code the bare minimum happy path" agile is no longer sufficient.

## Core Problem Statement

**The Multi-Agent Development Reality**: With Claude Code sub-agents enabling 8-12 concurrent coding agents per developer, traditional "just code the bare minimum happy path" agile development becomes impossible. The coordination complexity grows exponentially, requiring enterprise-grade infrastructure from day one.

**Current Failures at Scale**:
- **Work Loss**: Agent cleanup destroys completed work before integration
- **Workflow Fragmentation**: 90+ feature branches never merge to main  
- **State Corruption**: Dual coordination systems (kanban.yaml + git) create synchronization failures
- **Assignment Drift**: Agents become disconnected from their actual work
- **Observability Gaps**: No visibility into multi-agent decision paths and performance
- **Coordination Overhead**: Manual agent management becomes developer bottleneck

**Clambake Solution**: GitHub-native orchestration + Claude Code integration + Arize Phoenix observability = Complete multi-agent development platform that scales from day one to enterprise deployment.

## Architecture Philosophy

### GitHub-Native Everything
- **GitHub Issues** = Authoritative ticket system
- **GitHub Projects V2** = Sprint planning & backlog management
- **GitHub PRs** = Code review & integration pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** = CI/CD automation triggers
- **GitHub API** = Single source of truth for all coordination

### Agent Safety First
- **Work Preservation**: Never destroy work before it's safely integrated
- **Atomic Operations**: All state changes must be reversible and consistent
- **Conflict Prevention**: Proactive coordination prevents rather than resolves conflicts
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic detection and repair of coordination failures

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Test-First Architecture**: All components are designed with testability as primary concern
- **Behavior-Driven Specifications**: Every feature has comprehensive test coverage before implementation
- **Continuous Validation**: Agent orchestration workflows are continuously tested against real GitHub API
- **Regression Prevention**: Test suite prevents coordination failures from reoccurring
- **Agent Workflow Testing**: End-to-end tests simulate complete agent lifecycles

### DRY/SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles exactly one aspect of orchestration
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible for new agent types without modifying core coordination logic
- **Liskov Substitution**: Agent implementations are fully interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean API boundaries between GitHub integration, state management, and coordination
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core orchestration logic depends on abstractions, not GitHub API specifics
- **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Common patterns (state transitions, error handling, recovery) are abstracted into reusable components

### Claude Code Integration Philosophy
- **Sub-Agent Orchestration**: Leverage Claude Code's native sub-agent system for 8-12 concurrent agents
- **Git Worktree Coordination**: Use git worktrees to enable multiple Claude Code instances with shared local development setup
- **Extended Thinking Integration**: Automatic "think harder" triggers for complex coordination decisions
- **Context Management**: Intelligent /clear and context window management across agent sessions
- **Test-Driven Agent Development**: TDD workflows specifically designed for multi-agent concurrent development

### Arize Phoenix Observability Philosophy  
- **Day-One Observability**: Phoenix tracing integrated from first agent deployment, not as afterthought
- **OpenTelemetry Native**: OTLP-based instrumentation for vendor-agnostic, future-proof observability
- **Agent Decision Tracing**: Complete visibility into multi-agent coordination decisions and execution paths
- **Performance-Driven Optimization**: Data-driven agent assignment and workflow optimization
- **Development-Production Continuity**: Same observability stack from local development through production deployment

## Command Structure

```bash
# Project initialization - One-stop setup
clambake init                      # Initialize complete multi-agent development environment
clambake setup-claude              # Configure Claude Code sub-agent integration
clambake setup-phoenix             # Deploy Arize Phoenix observability stack

# Agent orchestration commands

# Developer experience
clambake dashboard                 # Launch unified monitoring dashboard
clambake logs [AGENT_ID]           # Stream agent execution logs
clambake context [AGENT_ID]        # Manage Claude Code agent context windows
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. Ticket Routing (`clambake route`)

**Input**: Available GitHub Issues with proper labels
**Output**: Assigned issues with Claude Code sub-agents deployed to git worktrees

```bash
# Route next available tickets to idle Claude Code sub-agents
clambake route --agents 8 --priority high --think-level hard

# Route specific ticket types with observability
clambake route --labels "bug,critical" --agents 3 --trace-level detailed

# Route with dependency checking and concurrent limits
clambake route --check-dependencies --max-concurrent 12 --load-balance
```

**Claude Code Sub-Agent Integration**:
- Spawns Claude Code sub-agents with specialized system prompts per ticket type
- Creates isolated git worktrees for each agent (enables shared local development setup)
- Configures agent context windows based on codebase size and ticket complexity
- Implements automatic `/clear` context management between tickets
- Triggers "think harder" mode for complex coordination decisions

**GitHub + Phoenix Integration**:
- Queries GitHub Issues with `status:open` and routing labels
- Checks agent availability via GitHub Project board status
- Creates feature branches with naming convention: `agent-{id}/{issue-number}-{slug}`
- Assigns GitHub Issue to agent user account
- Updates GitHub Project board with "In Progress" status
- **Phoenix Tracing**: Captures routing decision tree and agent assignment rationale
- **OTLP Instrumentation**: Records routing latency, conflict detection, and load balancing metrics

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Validates no conflicting work assignments across 8-12 concurrent agents
- Checks for dependency requirements in issue links
- Ensures agent capacity limits (max concurrent per agent type)
- Creates atomic GitHub API transaction for assignment
- **Phoenix Monitoring**: Alerts when routing conflicts or capacity violations occur

### 2. Work Integration (`clambake land`)

**Purpose**: Safely integrate completed Claude Code sub-agent work to main branch with full observability

```bash
# Land all ready work with Phoenix tracing
clambake land --auto-merge --trace-integration

# Land specific agent's work with performance analysis
clambake land --agent claude-agent-001 --require-review --analyze-performance

# Land with custom merge strategy and conflict prediction
clambake land --strategy squash --delete-branch --predict-conflicts
```

**Claude Code Integration Flow**:
1. **Agent Work Detection**: Scan Claude Code agent worktrees for completion signals
2. **Context Validation**: Verify agent completed work properly (no hanging context)
3. **Test Execution**: Run agent-generated tests to validate implementation
4. **Code Quality Gates**: Apply static analysis and formatting checks
5. **Worktree Cleanup**: Safely clean Claude Code agent workspace after PR creation

**GitHub + Phoenix Integration Flow**:
1. **Discovery**: Scan for agent branches with completed work indicators
2. **Phoenix Pre-Integration Tracing**: Record integration attempt with agent performance metrics
3. **PR Creation**: Create GitHub PR from agent branch to main with Phoenix trace links
4. **CI Validation**: Wait for GitHub Actions to pass with Phoenix performance monitoring
5. **Review Request**: Add reviewers based on project configuration and agent complexity analysis
6. **Auto-merge**: Merge when CI passes and reviews approve
7. **Phoenix Post-Integration Metrics**: Record successful integration metrics and agent productivity data
8. **Cleanup**: Delete feature branch and update issue status
9. **Notification**: Comment on issue with merge confirmation and Phoenix dashboard links

**Enterprise Work Preservation**:
- Never deletes branches until PR is successfully merged
- Creates backup refs before any destructive operations  
- Maintains audit trail of all integration attempts with Phoenix trace correlation
- Rollback capability if merge conflicts occur with automatic agent re-assignment
- **Phoenix Integration Monitoring**: Tracks integration success rates, time-to-merge, and agent productivity metrics

### 3. Agent Coordination (`clambake sync`)

**Purpose**: Maintain consistent state between local agent workspaces and GitHub

```bash
# Full synchronization
clambake sync --all

# Sync specific agents
clambate sync --agents agent-001,agent-002

# Sync with conflict resolution
clambake sync --resolve-conflicts --strategy github-wins
```

**Synchronization Process**:
1. **GitHub State Query**: Fetch current issue assignments and PR status
2. **Local State Discovery**: Scan agent workspaces for active work
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify state mismatches
4. **Resolution**: Apply configured conflict resolution strategy
5. **Update**: Synchronize both local and GitHub state
6. **Validation**: Verify synchronization success

### 4. Recovery Operations (`clambake recover`)

**Purpose**: Salvage work from orphaned branches and failed coordination

```bash
# Recover all orphaned branches
clambake recover --scan-all --dry-run

# Recover specific branch
clambake recover feature/agent-001/123-implement-auth

# Bulk recovery with pattern matching
clambake recover --pattern "agent-*" --create-prs
```

**Recovery Process**:
1. **Branch Analysis**: Analyze branch for meaningful commits
2. **Work Assessment**: Determine if branch contains completed features
3. **PR Creation**: Create recovery PR with detailed context
4. **Issue Linking**: Link PR to original issue if discoverable
5. **Review Assignment**: Assign for human review due to recovery context

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Agent States (GitHub Project Board Columns)
- **Available**: Ready for new ticket assignment
- **Assigned**: Has ticket but hasn't started work
- **In Progress**: Actively working on assigned ticket  
- **Review**: Work complete, PR created, awaiting review
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed, requires human intervention
- **Cleanup**: Agent completed, workspace being cleaned

### State Transitions

```mermaid
graph LR
    Available --> Assigned --> InProgress --> Review --> Available
    InProgress --> Blocked --> Available
    Review --> Cleanup --> Available
```

**State Management**:
- GitHub Project board is authoritative source for agent state
- GitHub Issue assignee tracks which agent owns which ticket
- GitHub PR status indicates work completion and review state
- Local workspace directories mirror GitHub state

### Agent Assignment Algorithm

```rust
// Pseudocode for intelligent ticket routing
fn route_tickets() -> Result<Vec<Assignment>> {
    let available_agents = github.get_available_agents()?;
    let pending_tickets = github.get_open_issues_with_routing_labels()?;
    
    for ticket in pending_tickets.priority_sorted() {
        let best_agent = find_optimal_agent(
            &available_agents,
            &ticket,
            &dependency_graph,
            &agent_workload
        )?;
        
        assign_ticket_to_agent(ticket, best_agent)?;
    }
}

fn find_optimal_agent(agents: &[Agent], ticket: &Issue, deps: &Graph, workload: &Map) -> Agent {
    // Factors:
    // 1. Agent availability
    // 2. Dependency conflicts with current assignments
    // 3. Workload balancing
    // 4. Agent skill matching (if configured)
    // 5. Geographic/timezone considerations
}
```

### Claude Code Integration Layer

**Sub-Agent Management**:
```rust
pub struct ClaudeCodeIntegration {
    agent_pool: Vec<ClaudeAgent>,
    worktree_manager: GitWorktreeManager,
    context_coordinator: ContextCoordinator,
    thinking_orchestrator: ThinkingOrchestrator,
}

impl ClaudeCodeIntegration {
    // Spawn specialized sub-agents based on ticket requirements
    pub async fn spawn_agent(&self, ticket: &GitHubIssue) -> Result<ClaudeAgent> {
        let agent_type = self.classify_ticket_complexity(ticket)?;
        let worktree = self.worktree_manager.create_isolated_workspace(ticket)?;
        let system_prompt = self.generate_specialized_prompt(ticket, agent_type)?;
        
        ClaudeAgent::new()
            .with_worktree(worktree)
            .with_system_prompt(system_prompt)
            .with_thinking_level(self.determine_thinking_level(ticket))
            .with_context_management(ContextStrategy::AutoClear)
            .spawn()
            .await
    }
    
    // Coordinate multiple agents working on related tickets
    pub async fn coordinate_agents(&self, agents: Vec<ClaudeAgent>) -> Result<CoordinationPlan> {
        // Prevent agents from conflicting on shared files
        // Implement dependency ordering for related tickets
        // Manage context window coordination
    }
}
```

**Thinking Level Integration**:
- **"think"**: Standard ticket complexity, basic coordination decisions
- **"think hard"**: Complex tickets with dependencies, integration requirements  
- **"think harder"**: Multi-agent coordination, conflict resolution, architectural decisions
- **"ultrathink"**: System-wide changes, complex refactoring, agent orchestration optimization

**Git Worktree Coordination**:
```bash
# Clambake automatically manages worktrees for agent isolation
worktrees/
├── agent-001/              # Feature: user authentication
├── agent-002/              # Feature: payment processing  
├── agent-003/              # Bug: performance optimization
└── shared/                 # Shared resources, documentation
```

### Arize Phoenix Observability Integration

**Day-One Observability Setup**:
```rust
pub struct PhoenixIntegration {
    tracer: OpenTelemetryTracer,
    evaluator: AgentEvaluator,
    metrics_collector: MetricsCollector,
    dashboard_manager: DashboardManager,
}

impl PhoenixIntegration {
    // Trace every agent decision and coordination step
    pub async fn trace_agent_workflow(&self, agent_id: &str, workflow: AgentWorkflow) {
        let span = self.tracer.start_span(&format!("agent-{}-workflow", agent_id));
        
        // Capture agent reasoning, code changes, test results
        span.set_attribute("agent.id", agent_id);
        span.set_attribute("ticket.id", workflow.ticket_id);
        span.set_attribute("thinking.level", workflow.thinking_level);
        span.set_attribute("context.tokens", workflow.context_usage);
        
        // Record coordination decisions
        for decision in workflow.coordination_decisions {
            self.trace_coordination_decision(&span, decision).await;
        }
    }
    
    // Evaluate agent performance in real-time
    pub async fn evaluate_agent_performance(&self, agent_id: &str) -> AgentMetrics {
        AgentMetrics {
            tickets_completed: self.get_completion_count(agent_id).await?,
            average_completion_time: self.get_avg_completion_time(agent_id).await?,
            code_quality_score: self.evaluate_code_quality(agent_id).await?,
            coordination_conflicts: self.get_conflict_count(agent_id).await?,
            integration_success_rate: self.get_integration_success_rate(agent_id).await?,
        }
    }
}
```

**Phoenix Dashboard Configuration**:
- **Agent Performance View**: Individual agent productivity, completion times, error rates
- **Coordination Health**: Multi-agent conflict detection, dependency resolution success
- **Integration Pipeline**: Work flow from agent completion to main branch integration
- **System Overview**: 8-12 agent utilization, resource consumption, bottleneck identification

- **Phase 2** (soon): agent001-agent003 for parallel development  
- **Phase 3** (stable): agent001-agent008 for full team coordination
- Agent assignment ≠ GitHub assignee (GitHub assignee is the human user)
- Tasks are 30-minute chunks that fit in one context window
- Branch naming: `work-{issue_number}` (e.g., `work-123`)

**Project Board Configuration**:
- **Backlog**: Issues ready for routing
- **Assigned**: Issues assigned to agents
- **In Progress**: Active agent work
- **Review**: PRs awaiting review/merge
- **Done**: Completed and merged

### API Usage Patterns

**Octocrab Integration with SOLID Design**:
```rust
use octocrab::Octocrab;

// Interface Segregation: Separate concerns into focused traits
pub trait TicketRouter {
    async fn get_available_tickets(&self) -> Result<Vec<Issue>>;
    async fn assign_ticket_to_agent(&self, issue: &Issue, agent: &Agent) -> Result<()>;
}

pub trait WorkIntegrator {
    async fn create_completion_pr(&self, branch: &str, issue: &Issue) -> Result<PullRequest>;
    async fn merge_completed_work(&self, pr: &PullRequest) -> Result<()>;
}

pub trait StateCoordinator {
    async fn sync_agent_states(&self) -> Result<SyncReport>;
    async fn detect_orphaned_work(&self) -> Result<Vec<OrphanedBranch>>;
}

pub trait BranchManager {
    async fn create_agent_branch(&self, issue: &Issue, agent: &Agent) -> Result<String>;
    async fn cleanup_merged_branches(&self) -> Result<CleanupReport>;
}

// Single Responsibility: GitHubOrchestrator composes focused services
pub struct GitHubOrchestrator {
    client: Octocrab,
    owner: String,
    repo: String,
    project_id: u64,
}

// Dependency Inversion: Core logic depends on abstractions
impl GitHubOrchestrator {
    pub fn new(client: Octocrab, owner: String, repo: String, project_id: u64) -> Self {
        Self { client, owner, repo, project_id }
    }
}

// Open/Closed: Implementations can be extended without modification
impl TicketRouter for GitHubOrchestrator { /* ... */ }
impl WorkIntegrator for GitHubOrchestrator { /* ... */ }
impl StateCoordinator for GitHubOrchestrator { /* ... */ }
impl BranchManager for GitHubOrchestrator { /* ... */ }
```

**Rate Limiting & Performance**:
- GitHub API rate limits: 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Batch operations where possible to minimize API calls
- Cache frequently accessed data (project structure, labels)
- Use GraphQL API for complex queries to reduce request count
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios

**GitHub API Failures**:
- Rate limiting: Implement exponential backoff
- Network failures: Retry with circuit breaker pattern
- Authentication issues: Clear error messages with fix guidance
- Permission errors: Validate GitHub permissions on startup

**Git Operation Failures**:
- Merge conflicts: Create conflict resolution PR for human review
- Branch deletion failures: Log and continue (branches can be cleaned manually)
- Remote sync failures: Retry with force push protection

**State Synchronization Failures**:
- GitHub/local state mismatch: Use configured conflict resolution strategy
- Missing branches: Recreate from GitHub state if possible
- Orphaned workspaces: Move to recovery queue for manual processing

### Recovery Mechanisms (DRY Pattern)

```rust
// DRY: Common recovery patterns abstracted into reusable components
pub trait RecoveryHandler<T> {
    async fn handle(&self, error: T) -> Result<RecoveryAction>;
    fn can_handle(&self, error: &T) -> bool;
}

// Single Responsibility: Each handler manages one type of failure
pub struct RateLimitHandler;
pub struct MergeConflictHandler;
pub struct StateMismatchHandler;
pub struct OrphanedWorkHandler;

// Template Method Pattern: Common recovery flow with specialized handling
pub struct RecoveryOrchestrator {
    handlers: Vec<Box<dyn RecoveryHandler<OrchestrationError>>>,
}

impl RecoveryOrchestrator {
    // DRY: Common recovery logic reused across all error types
    pub async fn recover(&self, error: OrchestrationError) -> Result<RecoveryAction> {
        for handler in &self.handlers {
            if handler.can_handle(&error) {
                match handler.handle(error.clone()).await {
                    Ok(action) => return Ok(action),
                    Err(recovery_error) => {
                        tracing::warn!("Recovery handler failed: {:?}", recovery_error);
                        continue;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Fallback: Move to human review queue
        Ok(RecoveryAction::EscalateToHuman { 
            error, 
            attempted_strategies: self.get_attempted_strategies() 
        })
    }
}

// Open/Closed: New recovery strategies can be added without modifying existing code
pub enum RecoveryStrategy {
    RetryWithBackoff { max_attempts: u32, base_delay: Duration },
    CreateRecoveryPR { assign_human_review: bool },
    MoveToQuarantine { notify_admin: bool },
    RollbackTransaction { preserve_work: bool },
    EscalateToHuman { error: OrchestrationError, attempted_strategies: Vec<String> },
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Target Performance Metrics

- **Routing Latency**: <2 seconds for ticket routing operation
- **Integration Time**: <5 minutes from agent completion to main merge
- **Sync Operations**: <10 seconds for full agent state synchronization
- **Recovery Scanning**: <30 seconds to scan for orphaned work
- **API Efficiency**: <50 GitHub API calls per routing operation

### Scalability Targets

- **Concurrent Agents**: Support 10+ agents simultaneously

- **Branch Management**: Manage 100+ active feature branches
- **Integration Volume**: Process 50+ PRs per day
- **Historical Data**: Handle projects with 10,000+ closed issues

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria

1. **Zero Work Loss**: No completed agent work is lost during coordination
2. **Reliable Integration**: 95%+ of completed work successfully merges to main
3. **State Consistency**: GitHub and local states remain synchronized
4. **Automated Recovery**: 90%+ of common failures recover automatically
5. **Workflow Integrity**: Complete feature lifecycle from routing to deployment

### Monitoring & Observability

**Built-in Metrics**:
- Agent productivity: tickets completed per day/week
- Integration success rate: PRs merged vs. PRs created
- Time to integration: agent completion to main merge
- Conflict resolution: automatic vs. manual resolution rates
- System health: API errors, sync failures, recovery events

**Integration with External Tools**:
- GitHub Insights for native metrics
- Prometheus metrics export for monitoring dashboards
- Structured logging for observability platforms
- Webhook support for real-time notifications

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation
- Deploy Clambake alongside existing kanban.yaml system
- Use read-only mode to verify GitHub state synchronization
- Validate routing decisions against manual assignments
- Test recovery operations on safe branches

### Phase 2: Gradual Transition  
- Route new tickets exclusively through Clambake
- Migrate existing work to GitHub-native workflows
- Implement integration pipelines for agent work
- Train team on new CLI commands and workflows

### Phase 3: Full Cutover
- Disable kanban.yaml-based workflows
- Remove dual state coordination systems
- Implement advanced features (dependency tracking, sprint management)
- Optimize performance based on real usage patterns

### Cleanup Strategy for Existing Disaster
- **Branch Analysis**: Scan 90+ orphaned branches for recoverable work
- **Triage Process**: Categorize branches by work value and completion state
- **Recovery PRs**: Create human-reviewed PRs for valuable orphaned work  
- **Archive Process**: Archive branches with no recoverable value
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain record of all recovery decisions for learning

## Testing Strategy (TDD Implementation)

### Test Pyramid Architecture

**Unit Tests (Foundation)**:
```rust
// Each component has comprehensive unit test coverage
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_ticket_routing_respects_agent_capacity() {
        // Given: Agent with max capacity of 2, already has 1 ticket
        // When: Attempt to route 2 more tickets
        // Then: Only 1 ticket should be assigned
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_work_integration_preserves_commits() {
        // Given: Agent branch with 3 commits
        // When: Integration process encounters merge conflict
        // Then: All commits are preserved in recovery PR
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_state_sync_resolves_conflicts_consistently() {
        // Given: GitHub shows agent as "available", local shows "working"
        // When: Sync with "github-wins" strategy
        // Then: Local state updated to match GitHub
    }
}
```

**Integration Tests (GitHub API)**:
```rust
// Test against real GitHub API with isolated test repositories
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_end_to_end_ticket_routing_workflow() {
    let orchestrator = setup_test_orchestrator().await;
    
    // Test complete workflow: route → assign → branch creation → status update
    let tickets = orchestrator.get_available_tickets().await?;
    let assignment = orchestrator.route_tickets(tickets).await?;
    
    assert_github_issue_assigned(&assignment.issue_id).await?;
    assert_branch_exists(&assignment.branch_name).await?;
    assert_project_board_updated(&assignment.agent_id).await?;
}
```

**End-to-End Tests (Agent Lifecycle)**:
```rust
// Simulate complete agent workflows from routing to integration
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_complete_agent_lifecycle_with_recovery() {
    // Test: Route → Work → Complete → Integrate → Cleanup → Recover (if needed)
}
```

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**Feature Specifications**:
```gherkin
Feature: Agent Work Preservation
  As a development team using autonomous agents
  I want completed work to never be lost during coordination failures
  So that agent productivity is not wasted

  Scenario: Agent completes work but cleanup fails
    Given an agent has completed work on a feature branch
    And the cleanup process encounters a git error
    When the recovery system activates
    Then the completed work is preserved in a recovery PR
    And the original issue is linked to the recovery PR
    And human review is requested for the recovery
```

### Continuous Testing Integration

**Test Categories**:
- **Pre-commit Tests**: Fast unit tests that prevent broken code from entering repository
- **CI Pipeline Tests**: Integration tests that validate GitHub API interactions
- **Staging Tests**: End-to-end tests against staging environment with agent simulations
- **Production Monitoring**: Continuous validation that coordination workflows are functioning

// Dependency Inversion: Core logic depends on abstractions
pub struct OrchestrationContainer {
    github_client: Arc<dyn GitHubClient>,
    ticket_router: Arc<dyn TicketRouter>,
    work_integrator: Arc<dyn WorkIntegrator>,
    state_coordinator: Arc<dyn StateCoordinator>,
    recovery_orchestrator: Arc<dyn RecoveryOrchestrator>,
}

impl OrchestrationContainer {
    // Open/Closed: New implementations can be injected without code changes
    pub fn new(config: &Config) -> Result<Self> {
        let github_client = Arc::new(OctocrabClient::new(config.github.clone())?);
        
        Ok(Self {
            github_client: github_client.clone(),
            ticket_router: Arc::new(GitHubTicketRouter::new(github_client.clone())),

## Clambake Value Proposition: One-Stop Multi-Agent Development

### The Multi-Agent Development Reality

**Traditional Approach**: "Just code the bare minimum happy path" worked when development was sequential, single-developer focused, and complexity was manageable through simple coordination.

**New Reality**: With Claude Code sub-agents enabling 8-12 concurrent coding agents per developer, traditional approaches fail catastrophically. The coordination complexity grows exponentially, requiring enterprise-grade infrastructure from day one.

### Why Clambake Exists

**Target Users**: Developers who want to leverage multi-agent development for webapp creation but don't want to build coordination infrastructure from scratch.

**Core Value**: Clambake provides the **complete infrastructure stack** that makes multi-agent concurrent development feasible:

1. **GitHub-Native Orchestration**: Professional ticket routing, branch management, PR workflows
2. **Claude Code Integration**: Seamless sub-agent deployment, worktree isolation, context management  
3. **Arize Phoenix Observability**: Day-one monitoring, performance optimization, debugging capabilities
4. **Enterprise-Grade Coordination**: State consistency, work preservation, conflict resolution
5. **Developer Experience**: Single CLI that handles the entire multi-agent lifecycle

### Competitive Landscape

**Current Options**:
- **Manual Coordination**: Developers manually manage agents → leads to work loss, conflicts, chaos
- **Custom Solutions**: Teams build their own orchestration → recreates event-api disaster at scale  
- **Single-Agent Tools**: Cline, Aider → don't scale to 8-12 concurrent agents
- **Enterprise Platforms**: Complex, expensive, not designed for individual developers

**Clambake Advantage**: 
- **One Command Setup**: `clambake init` creates complete multi-agent development environment
- **Battle-Tested Architecture**: Based on learnings from event-api coordination failures
- **Industry Standard Integrations**: Claude Code + Arize Phoenix + GitHub = proven stack
- **Scales with Teams**: Individual developer → startup → enterprise deployment

### Success Metrics for Multi-Agent Development

**What Clambake Enables**:
- **8-12 concurrent agents** working on the same codebase without conflicts
- **Zero work loss** during agent coordination and cleanup
- **95%+ integration success rate** from agent completion to main branch
- **<2 second routing latency** for ticket assignment to available agents
- **Complete observability** of agent decision-making and performance
- **Automated recovery** from 90%+ of coordination failures

**Developer Productivity Impact**:
- **10x development velocity** through concurrent agent deployment
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** without enterprise infrastructure overhead
- **Day-one observability** preventing coordination issues before they scale
- **Professional workflows** that scale from proof-of-concept to production

### The "Just Works" Multi-Agent Experience

**Day 1: Project Initialization**
```bash
git init my-webapp
cd my-webapp
clambake init --project-type webapp --agents 8
# Complete multi-agent development environment ready
```

**Day 2-N: Development Workflow**
```bash
clambake route --priority high        # Route tickets to agents
clambake status                       # Monitor agent progress  
clambake land                         # Integrate completed work
clambake dashboard                    # View Phoenix observability
```

**Month 1-N: Scale and Optimize**
```bash
clambake metrics --analyze-performance    # Optimize agent allocation
clambake agents --scale-to 12             # Scale concurrent capacity
clambake traces --debug-bottlenecks       # Data-driven optimization
```

### Future Vision: Multi-Agent Development Standard

**Short Term**: Clambake becomes the standard way to set up multi-agent development for webapps
**Medium Term**: Integration ecosystem grows (Linear, Slack, VS Code, monitoring tools)
**Long Term**: Multi-agent development workflows become the new standard, replacing single-developer sequential development

The goal is a GitHub-native orchestration system that makes autonomous agent development as reliable and predictable as traditional human development workflows, while operating at the 8-12 concurrent agent scale that modern AI development enables. Built with TDD practices and SOLID principles to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and reliability at enterprise scale - delivered as a single Rust CLI that "just works" for any developer wanting to leverage multi-agent development productivity.

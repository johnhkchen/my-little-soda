// Mock implementations for testing - no side effects
// This module is currently minimal as the current agent lifecycle architecture
// uses the state machine pattern with simple in-memory state management

// Placeholder for future mock implementations if needed
// The current state machine architecture is simple enough that most tests
// can work directly with the AgentStateMachine struct without complex mocking

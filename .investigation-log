Issue #437 Investigation Results

Issue: [TEST-DEBT] A2-Syntax errors in field access for test result structs

Investigation Date: 2025-09-05
Status: ALREADY RESOLVED

Findings:
- The syntax errors described in the issue (hyphenated field names like `my-little-soda_dir_created`) no longer exist in the codebase
- All field access in tests/c1a_empty_repository_test.rs correctly uses underscores: `my_little_soda_dir_created`
- The test file compiles successfully with no syntax errors
- Tests run (though some fail for unrelated reasons about existing configuration files)

Resolution:
The syntax errors described in issue #437 have already been fixed in a previous commit.
The field access now correctly uses underscores throughout the codebase.
No further action required - issue can be closed as resolved.
